A software for collaboration and information sharing between Linux.

## Under development, do not clone please :-)

The application is designed to interconnect multiple devices on Linux. I'm going to emulate the interconnection of everything between Hongmeng OS devices and implement it on Linux.


The software is implemented in c++, based on GTK3. Build with CMake & Ninja.
